Iâ€™m a full-stack developer focused on building custom e-commerce experiences from scratch.
My main tools are JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Node.js â€” and I love turning product ideas into real, functional online stores.

Iâ€™ve built projects like ModaSphere, a complete e-commerce template with admin panel, API modules (Cart, Orders, Auth, Products), and Stripe integration â€” plus a live demo for testing and showcasing.
I also created SkandiWall, a minimalist storefront inspired by Nordic design.

Recently, I explored Shopify Headless by building a lightweight front end using the Storefront GraphQL API â€” just to better understand modern headless architectures and show flexibility across platforms.

I enjoy crafting fast, accessible, and clean interfaces, managing cloud deployments (Vercel, Railway), and collaborating in small agile teams. Always curious, always learning.

ðŸ‘‰ Looking to join a startup, tech team, or freelance mission where I can bring value, ship meaningful features, and grow with passionate people.
